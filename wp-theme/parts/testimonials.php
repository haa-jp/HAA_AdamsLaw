<p>Rebecca Adams has done a terrific job for me!  Anytime I have called to ask her questions she has treated me with the utmost respect.  I always felt as though she treated me like a friend of many years, not cold and condescending as some lawyers can get.  She was truly outstanding in the courtroom as well.  When you appear before the Judge with Rebecca, you can tell she has spent years building the same type of relationship with everyone else in the room.  She is clearly well liked and trusted as an attorney.  She was able to negotiate with the prosecutor and I received the best possible outcome I could have hoped for.  I also felt informed throughout her representation.  I felt that I always knew what was going to happen next.  Thank you Rebecca Adams!</p>

<p>While returning from a trip out of state, I was detained on a felony traffic stop. During the stop, they found illegal substances as well as a firearm in my possession. Because it was a felony Stop the police could seize and forfeit my Vehicle. Ms. Adams worked diligently to have my vehicle returned to me and did so a short time later. My final plea bargain in the case was reduced to improper storage of a firearm. MS Adams represented my best interest and obtained results beyond my initial hopes.</p>

<p>My 16 year old daughter was involved in an automobile accident. She was charged with reckless driving. Rebecca did an awesome job. She met with the prosecutor &amp; judge. She negotiated a stay of adjudication. All charges were dismissed after one year and no criminal record.</p>
<p>Thanks Rebecca!</p>
